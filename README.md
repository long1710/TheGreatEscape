# Card Agaisnt Covidnity
venting frustration on Covid situation

- Covid has caused griefing all over the world, as such I am creating this simple game that allows you to turn the table on Covid
- The game is intended to be multiplayer with a single goal is to pent up/ relief your story regarding the Covid. The game will share similar characteristic of Card Agaisnt Humanity and Don't starve together. Each player will take turn picking up a pile of cards, with a certain specific questions such as: 
+ Name one positive thing you have done in the Covid season
+ if Covid was a rock, what would you do to it. 
 There will be three primary classes: 
 - Covid: the Covid has a life point of 30. The game end when Covid health reduce to 30 or the player heath or sanity reach 0 ( more winning will be add later );
 - Board: Contains card events with good ending or bad ending, there are multiple types of card
 - Players: The player has Sanity Points, Health and Money. 
 
+ Each Board will have approximately 40 - 50 cards ( for prototype, just 20 is enough )
+ Covid will have some power depends on the time progress and certain condition trigger
+ Players need to balance between Sanity, Health and Money 
+ Each Player can work together or sabotage each other
